Amazon's relational database service (RDS) has set high standards for reliable,
low-maintenance databases as a service.

But what if due to privacy, costs- or vendor lock-in reasons your organization
decided to use a different or even multiple hosting options. What if due to the
size of your company and many software development teams, you would like to
provide own database server instances to every separate team and every running
self-contained system (SCS). You can read more on SCS architecture `theory`_
and `practical realization`_.

So you wish something like RDS, but on premises or with flexible hosting
options. Use the

as an inspiration or :doc:`start with a walk-through! <getting-started>`
