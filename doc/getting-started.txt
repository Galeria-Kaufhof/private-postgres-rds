1. Create servers
-----------------

Creating servers, VMs or bare metal is outside of the scope of this project.
Use whatever tools you always use:

* on openstack run ``nova`` or ``heat``
* on bare metal use some sort of PXE boot, or insert a USB stick or CD
* or use some orchestration tool based on terraform or ansible

Typical setup will include 2 servers for every development team for every
"zone", e.g. ``production``, ``integration``:

* a **master**, which will be available for read-write operations and will be
  registered within DNS or service discovery under **service name**
* a hot-standby **slave**, which can quickly take over in case the master gets
  broken

Choose some naming convention like and name servers according to it. For
``integration`` zone/stage and the ``orderdata`` topic or team create two
servers::

  int-postgres-orderdata-1.int.example.com
  int-postgres-orderdata-2.int.example.com

* install minimal e.g. Ubuntu or CentOS system
* ensure key-based ssh works from your machine and you can ssh as root

2. Install prerequisites::
--------------------------

  # clone this project
  git clone https://github.com/Galeria-Kaufhof/private-postgres-rds.git

  # prepare space to save generated credentials
  mkdir postgres-credentials

  # prepare configuration file to define specifics of your organization
  # you can just copy and adjust the sample:
  cp private-postgres-rds/lib/organization_conf.py.sample <some-folder>/organization_conf.py
  # now adjust the file
  vim ...
  export RDS_ORGANIZATION_CONF=<full-path-to-the-file-you-ve-just-created>

  cd private-postgres-rds
  invoke --list
  # Create project specific python virtual environment in a subfolder
  invoke --help sync_virtualenv

3. Install postgres on every server::
-------------------------------------

  invoke --help initialize_servers

4. Configure postgres cluster
-----------------------------

  invoke --help configure_cluster

After a successful run of ``configure_cluster`` you will see instructions,
how to access your new postgres from psql and the ``admin`` password, you can
forward to developer teams.
